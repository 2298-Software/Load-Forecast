# Load Forecasting 

The goal of this project is to accurately predict the load that will be required on an electric grid.
This typically will be a load forecast for the next n-hours in the future.

We will be using Facebook's Prophet framework.

The project includes a historical_load.csv file which contains 5 years of hourly voltage readings
for a circuit.

Use [conf.yml](src/main/conf.yml) to customize inputs.

This repo is the code for a blog post on load forecasting and can be found
